# Terminology Usage Manual

The following is a guide describing how to use common words, names, and phrases in our documentation. The goal of this document is to make sure that we are being consistent across all documentation. Entries that only show correct punctuation or capitalization have no further explanation. Product and brand names from other companies are taken directly from that company's website/documentation.
